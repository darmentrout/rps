# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This game was built with React and keeps a running log of the player's activity. 

The game can be played in a browser after running a build (`npm run build`) and starting a static file server (such as `http-server`) in the build folder. A development server can also be instantiated with `npm start` in the project's root folder.
